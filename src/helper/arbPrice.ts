  * Function to get the current price of ARB from coingecko
  When going over blocks that were skipped due to downtime, we'll need to provide the block number to
  get the price at that point in time when the transaction occurred
  Now, for historical data, coingecko stores data in such a format
    1 day from current time = 5 minute interval data
    2 - 90 days of date range = hourly data
    above 90 days of date range = daily data (00:00 UTC)
  so, from the block number, we can calculate the time difference and depending on how old the block is,
  we can calculate the start and end time to fetch the price from coingecko
  Coingecko would provide an array of timestamps and prices, and we will have to find the closest price just before the block time
  and use that as the price for the transaction
  We can't use the closest price after the block time, because the transaction would have occurred before that time
  *
  * @param blockNumber - The block number at which the transaction occurred, if not provided, the current price is fetched
  * @returns The price of ARB, either at the current time or at the block number provided
